Servlets

Web Application
===============
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web pages / Passive web pages
-----------------------------------
A web page which shows same content is called static web page.

ex:
	Home page 
	Aboutus page 
	services page 
	contactus page 
	and etc.
 

2) Dynamic web pages / Active web pages 
--------------------------------------
A web page which shows different content is called dynamic web page.

ex:
	live cricket score page 
	stock market share value page
	gmail inbox 
	and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource programs
--------------------------------
A static web resource program is used to generate static web pages.

ex:
	HTML program 
	CSS program
	Bootstrap program
	angularjs program
	reactjs program 
	and etc.


2) Dynamic web resource programs 
---------------------------------
A dynamic web resource program is used to generate dynamic web pages.
ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program 
	and etc.


Based on the position and execution these web resource programs are divided into two types.

1) Client side web resource programs
------------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at client side(browser window) is called client side web resource program.

ex:
	HTML program 
	CSS program
	Bootstrap program
	angularjs program 
	reactjs program 
	and etc.

2) Server side web resource programs 
------------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.

ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program 
	and etc.

Web application and Web Resource program execution
==================================================
Diagram : servlet1.1

Java application will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program executes when we have requested.So there is no chance of executing them seperately.

With respect to the diagram: 

1) Enduser will give the request to web resource program.

2) Server will trap that request and passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) Web resource program will execute the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program communicates with database if neccessary.

5) Web resource program will give the output to web server.

6) Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic response.
 

Deployment
----------
The process of taking the web application and keep in a server is called deployment and reverse if called undeployment.



Web Server
=========
Web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	Tomcat, Resin and etc.

Responsibilities of web server
------------------------------- 
1) It takes continues request from client.

2) It passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web application.

4) It allows us to execute client side web resource programs at browser window.

5) It will gather the result from web resource program and send to browser window as dynamic     
   response.

6) It will automate whole process of web application and web resource program.

7) It will add middleware services only to deployed web application.


Web Container
==============
Web container is a software application which is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource program.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and jsp container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and jsp container.so we don't need to arrange it seperately.

Note:
----
	Servlet program executed by servlet container.
	JSP program executed by jsp container.



Tomcat 
========
Version			:	7.x 

Creator 		:      James Duncan Davidson

Vendor			:      Apache Software Foundation

Port No			:      8080

Website			:      https://tomcat.apache.org

open source		:      open source 

servlet container	:      Catalina 

Jsp container 		:      Jasper 

Download link 		: 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9rC21sL6v0tZFdVcmxZUDA0Tms/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-VXlB_IpeWqDWwdbr1baCyA


Before 6.x version, Tomcat is known as web server. But from 6.x version onwards Tomcat is also know as application server.

Tomcat is not a container .It is a server containing servlet container and jsp container.

Tomcat installation will ask following four things.

1) Http Connector port 

2) adminstrator username and password 

3) JRE location (parallel to JDK folder)

4) Tomcat Installation location 


Installation of tomcat server
------------------------------
Right click to tomcat software --> yes ---> Next --> I Agree --> select Full -->
---> Next ---> 

Http connector port : 2525

adminstrative username : admin
	      password : admin   

--> next --> Next --> Install. 


Keeping Tomcat server from automatic mode to manual mode
========================================================
services (view local services) --> select Apache Tomcat --> click to stop link -->
double click to Apache tomcat --> startup type: manual -->Apply -->ok.
