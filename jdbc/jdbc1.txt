JDBC
====
As if know it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is called Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store inside RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our application writing the data in a file or database software.

File and Database software acts like a permanent storage device or medium.

Persistence
============
The process of storing the data and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Important terminologies
=======================
1) Persistence store 
--------------------
	It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
	ex:
		Files
		Database software's

2) Persistence data 
-------------------
	Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
	ex:
		Records 
		Tables 

3) Persistence operation
-----------------------
	Insert,Update,Delete,Create,Select and etc are called persistence operations.
	In the realtime it is also known as CURD operation, CRUD operation or SCUD operation.
	ex:
		C - create 	S - select 
		U - update 	C - create 
		R - read        U - update 
		D - delete      D - delete 

4) Persistence logic 
-------------------
	A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
	ex:
		IOStream 
		JDBC Code

5) Persistence technology 
----------------------
	A technology which is used to develop persistence logics is called persistence technology.
	ex:
		JDBC
		Hibernate 
		Ibatis 
		and etc


Q) What is JDBC? 

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.


Note:
-----

				IOStream 
	JavaApp	------------------------------------------ Files 
			Serialization/Deserialization 


				JDBC Code 
	JavaApp ------------------------------------------ Database 


Serialization
-------------
The process of take the data from object and storing a file is called serialization.

In general, converting from object state to file state is called serialization.

In serialization object will not store in a file.Object data will store in a file.

Diagram: jdbc1.1


Deserialization
----------------
The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.

In general, converting from file state to object state is called deserialization.

Limitations with files as a persistence store
==============================================
> It will store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not allows us to apply constraints.

> It does not show an application with relationship.

> Upation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.

Advantages of Database as a persistence store
=============================================
> We can store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> Fetching the data with multiple condition is possible.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.


Every JDBC application is a two-tier application.Java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

Enduser is a non-technical person. They can't prepare and execute SQL query in database software.
They depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

JDBC Driver
==========
JDBC Driver acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

ex:

	JDBC -----------------------JDBC Driver ------------ Database 

ODBC Driver
============
VBScript, Perl, D2k and other technologies uses ODBC drivers to locate and interact with database.

ex:

	VBScript ------------------- ODBC Driver ----------- Database



ODBC driver is developed by using c language by taking the support of pointers.But Java does not support pointers.To overcome this limitation Sun Micro System introduced JDBC driver exclusively.

We will get JDBC softwares from three parties.

1) Sun Micro System (creator of JDBC driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 


We will get ODBC softwares from three parties.

1) Xopen company (creator of ODBC driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor
